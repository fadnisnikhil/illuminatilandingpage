Technical Requirements Document (TRD)
1. Introduction
Purpose:
This document defines the technical blueprint for developing the “Illuminati” energy drink website using an AI-driven process. It aligns with best practice templates and borrows actionable components from InACan’s website structure, ensuring every element is interactive or linked to further actions.

Scope:
The website will be a modern, responsive platform that includes interactive pages, clear navigation, and dynamic content. It is designed to showcase product details, brand story, manufacturing insights, lifestyle galleries, store locators, blog/news content, and contact forms.

2. System Architecture
Overview:

Frontend:

Utilize a modern JavaScript framework (React, Vue.js, or Angular) to build a single-page application (SPA) offering smooth page transitions, interactive animations, and dynamic content updates.
Use a mobile-first approach and ensure all components are touch and keyboard accessible.
Backend:

Deploy a headless CMS (such as Strapi or Contentful) to manage dynamic content (product details, blog posts, store data).
Build RESTful APIs (or GraphQL endpoints) to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.
Integration:

Integrate third-party services for analytics (e.g., Google Analytics), payment (if e-commerce is enabled), maps (for store locator), and social media sharing.
Ensure that every visual element or content block which appears on the site is accompanied by a user action (e.g., “Learn More,” “Buy Now,” “Submit,” “View Gallery”).
3. Technical Specifications
3.1 Frontend Requirements
Responsive & Adaptive:

All pages must render properly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Use fluid grids and media queries to maintain consistency.
Interactivity:

Implement hover states, clickable cards, and animated transitions.
Ensure that every content block (images, text sections, CTA buttons) links to an actionable page or function.
Performance & Optimization:

Optimize assets (images, scripts) to ensure page load times remain under 3 seconds.
Utilize lazy loading for images and code splitting for JavaScript modules.
Accessibility:

Adhere to WCAG guidelines (proper contrast ratios, alt text for images, keyboard navigability).
3.2 Backend Requirements
API & CMS Integration:

Use a headless CMS to provide an easy-to-update content backend.
Develop secure API endpoints to fetch product details, blog content, store locations, and brand information.
Database:

Employ a scalable database solution (SQL or NoSQL) to manage dynamic data (user accounts, store listings, orders if applicable).
Security:

Enforce HTTPS for all transmissions.
Implement robust authentication for admin operations.
Use measures to prevent XSS, CSRF, and SQL Injection attacks.
3.3 Deployment & Infrastructure
Hosting & CDN:

Cloud-based hosting (AWS, GCP, or Azure) with auto-scaling capabilities.
Integrate a Content Delivery Network to improve asset delivery and global performance.
CI/CD Pipeline:

Set up continuous integration and deployment workflows to automate testing, integration, and production rollouts.
Monitoring & Logging:

Implement real-time performance monitoring and logging systems (using ELK stack, New Relic, or similar).
4. Site Architecture & Page-Specific Technical Details
Each page is designed with actionable components:

Homepage:

Actionable Elements: Main navigation menu, dynamic “Learn More” buttons, animated product highlights.
Interactive Sections: A hero slider or video banner with CTA buttons that lead to product details or brand story pages.
Age/Disclaimer (if required):

Action: (Optional) An age or disclaimer verification form if regulatory requirements apply.
Note: For non-alcoholic energy drinks, this may be replaced with a health/caffeine disclaimer popup that users must acknowledge.
Product/Drink Page (Inspired by “Our Cocktails”):

Action: Clickable product cards that show detailed descriptions, nutritional information, and “Buy Now” or “Find Retailer” buttons.
Lifestyle Gallery (Inspired by “INACAN Scenes”):

Action: Interactive image/video gallery cards that expand into lightboxes or lead to dedicated gallery pages.
Brand Story (Inspired by “Our Story”):

Action: Scrollable interactive timeline with “Read More” expandable sections, each section linking to detailed pages.
Manufacturing/Innovation (Adapted from “Our Distillery”):

Action: Virtual tour or interactive map of the production facility, with hotspots that open detail modals.
Store Locator:

Action: Interactive map integrated with location services; clickable markers show store details and “Get Directions” actions.
Blogs/News:

Action: A list of blog entries with clickable titles leading to full posts; social share buttons integrated.
Contact:

Action: Fully functional contact form with validation, clickable email/phone links, and integrated chat or inquiry submission.
